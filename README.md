# FlubBot
This is the code of Flub bot - A Discord bot I am working on for the Offical Flub Discord Server: https://discord.gg/W9XWFGs
Current Features:
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Flub bot has a 10% chance to reply to a message sent in a discord server.
He has a 5% chance to run an image, posted by a user, through the deepdream API four times. 
This can also be done manulally by use the caption '$flube' when uploading a photo onto discord, however when you do it manually
flub bot runs the images through the API ten times.

Future Plans:
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
We would like to enable voice chat on flub bot, where he can join a channel of a user who calles him using the token '$flub'
and play some sort of audio clip for the user.
Another feature we would like to add, is whenever a user uploads an image to the server flub bot should have some low chance of taking
that image and hiding a "flub" in that image.
